# TASK ARCHIVING PROTOCOL

> **TL;DR:** After completing a task, archive it in completed_tasks.md with Implementation Results, Completed Testing, Lessons Learned, and Documentation Updates sections. Cross-link in progress.md and activeContext.md.

## üìÅ ARCHIVE SETUP

At project start:
1. Create `docs/archive/` directory
2. Create `completed_tasks.md` with only this header:
   ```markdown
   # Completed Tasks
   ```
3. Don't add placeholder text like "No tasks completed yet"

## üìã ARCHIVE FORMAT

For each completed task, use this exact format:

```markdown
## Task: [Task Name] (v1.0)
Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD

### Implementation Results
[What was implemented]

### Completed Testing
[How it was tested]

### Lessons Learned
[Key insights gained]

### Documentation Updates
[Memory Bank files updated]
```

See examples: [archive-examples.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/Extended%20Details/archive-examples.mdc)

## üîÑ CROSS-LINKING

After archiving, create these cross-links:

### In progress.md:
```markdown
## Completed Tasks
- [Task Name] - Completed on YYYY-MM-DD, see [archive entry](mdc:../docs/archive/completed_tasks.md#task-task-name-v10)
```

### In activeContext.md:
```markdown
## Recent Completions
- [Task Name] has been completed and archived. Next focus is on [Next Task].
```

## ‚úÖ ARCHIVE CHECKLIST

Verify these items for every archive:

- [ ] docs/archive directory exists
- [ ] completed_tasks.md exists with proper header
- [ ] Archive entry includes:
  - Task name with (v1.0) version
  - Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - All four required sections
- [ ] No placeholder text remains
- [ ] progress.md updated with archive link
- [ ] activeContext.md updated with completion note

## üîç SECTION REQUIREMENTS

1. **Implementation Results**
   - List specific features implemented
   - Note any deviations from original plan
   - Mention technologies used

2. **Completed Testing**
   - Describe testing methods used
   - Note test results and coverage
   - Mention any edge cases tested

3. **Lessons Learned**
   - Include specific technical insights
   - Note what worked well and what didn't
   - Include recommendations for future work

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - List all Memory Bank files updated
   - Note major changes to project documentation
   - Mention any new patterns documented

‚úì **Checkpoint:** Have I included all four sections with sufficient detail?
