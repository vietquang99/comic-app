# REFLECTION FORMAT

> **TL;DR:** Every task requires a reflection with four specific sections: What Went Well (‚â•3 items), Challenges (‚â•2 items), Lessons Learned (‚â•3 items), and Improvements for Next Time (‚â•3 items). Be specific and detailed, not generic.

## üìù REFLECTION STRUCTURE

Always use this exact structure:

```markdown
## REFLECTION

### What Went Well
- [Specific success 1]
- [Specific success 2]
- [Specific success 3]

### Challenges
- [Specific challenge 1]
- [Specific challenge 2]

### Lessons Learned
- [Specific lesson 1]
- [Specific lesson 2]
- [Specific lesson 3]

### Improvements for Next Time
- [Specific improvement 1]
- [Specific improvement 2]
- [Specific improvement 3]
```

## üìä SECTION REQUIREMENTS

Each section has specific requirements:

1. **What Went Well**
   - Include ‚â•3 specific successes
   - Focus on technical details that worked
   - Mention effective decisions
   - Use concrete examples

2. **Challenges**
   - Include ‚â•2 specific challenges
   - Describe how each was addressed
   - Be honest about difficulties
   - Note solutions implemented

3. **Lessons Learned**
   - Include ‚â•3 specific insights
   - Focus on technical learnings
   - Include both positive and negative
   - Note knowledge for future tasks

4. **Improvements for Next Time**
   - Include ‚â•3 specific improvements
   - Be concrete about future approaches
   - Focus on actionable changes
   - Note process improvements

## üîç SPECIFICITY GUIDE

### ‚ùå Too Vague (Avoid)
- "The code works well"
- "There were some challenges"
- "Testing could be improved"

### ‚úÖ Properly Specific
- "The modular component architecture allowed for easy unit testing"
- "Initial performance issues with the data filtering algorithm required optimization using memoization"
- "Implementing a more detailed technical specification phase would clarify edge cases before coding"

## ‚úì REFLECTION CHECKPOINTS

Before completing a reflection, verify:
- [ ] All four sections included with exact headings
- [ ] "What Went Well" has ‚â•3 specific items
- [ ] "Challenges" has ‚â•2 specific items
- [ ] "Lessons Learned" has ‚â•3 specific items
- [ ] "Improvements for Next Time" has ‚â•3 specific items
- [ ] Content is specific and detailed
- [ ] Sections are in the correct order
