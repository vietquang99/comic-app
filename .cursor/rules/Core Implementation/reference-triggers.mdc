# ENHANCED REFERENCE TRIGGERS

> **TL;DR:** Use the standardized ðŸ“š REFERENCE CHECK template when consulting example files. Document key insights extracted from reference files. Mandatory reference points are at the start of each major workflow section.

## ðŸ“š STANDARDIZED REFERENCE CHECK FORMAT

Each time you need to consult a reference file, use this standardized format:

```
ðŸ“š REFERENCE CHECK:
- CONSULTING: [file name]
- PURPOSE: [specific reason for consulting]
- CRITICAL ELEMENTS: [key items to look for]

Key insights:
- [Key insight 1]
- [Key insight 2]
- [Key insight 3]

âœ“ Reference consultation complete
```

## ðŸ“š KEY EXAMPLE FILES 

### 1. workflow-examples.mdc
Contains essential examples for workflow implementation:
- Initialization format
- Documentation setup
- Task planning structure
- Section transitions

### 2. command-examples.mdc
Contains examples for proper command execution:
- Single command format
- Command documentation
- Result reporting
- Platform-specific adaptations

### 3. reflection-examples.mdc
Contains examples for structured reflection:
- "What Went Well" format
- "Challenges" format
- "Lessons Learned" format
- "Improvements for Next Time" format

### 4. archive-examples.mdc
Contains examples for proper archiving:
- Archive entry format
- Cross-linking format
- Archive cleanup

### 5. creative-phase-examples.mdc
Contains examples for structured creative phases:
- Algorithm design creative phases
- UI design creative phases
- Architecture planning creative phases
- Level-specific examples
- Systematic verification approach

## ðŸ“š MANDATORY REFERENCE POINTS

At these points in the workflow, you MUST consult the specified reference files:

1. **Start of INITIALIZATION**: 
   - workflow-examples.mdc

2. **Start of TASK PLANNING**:
   - workflow-examples.mdc

3. **Before FIRST COMMAND in IMPLEMENTATION**:
   - command-examples.mdc

4. **Start of REFLECTION**:
   - reflection-examples.mdc

5. **Start of ARCHIVING**:
   - archive-examples.mdc

6. **When encountering PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ISSUES**:
   - platform-awareness.mdc

## ðŸ“š REFERENCE CHECK EXAMPLES

### Initialization Reference Check:

```
ðŸ“š REFERENCE CHECK:
- CONSULTING: workflow-examples.mdc
- PURPOSE: Ensuring proper initialization format
- CRITICAL ELEMENTS: Task objective, Status tracking, Verification commitment

Key insights:
- Must include task name and specific objective
- Must create section tracking list with 6 sections
- Must make verification commitment
- Must review all Memory Bank files
- Must identify platform and document requirements

```

### Command Execution Reference Check:

```
ðŸ“š REFERENCE CHECK:
- CONSULTING: command-examples.mdc
- PURPOSE: Ensuring proper command documentation
- CRITICAL ELEMENTS: Command format, platform awareness, error handling

Key insights:
- Must document platform considerations before execution
- Must execute commands one at a time
- Must document success OR failure after execution
- Must provide alternative approaches for failed commands
- Must add real-time updates after significant commands

âœ“ Reference consultation complete
```

### Platform-Specific Reference Check:

```
ðŸ“š REFERENCE CHECK:
- CONSULTING: platform-awareness.mdc
- PURPOSE: Adapting commands for current platform
- CRITICAL ELEMENTS: OS-specific syntax, path differences, command alternatives

Key insights:
- Windows uses backslashes, Unix uses forward slashes
- Windows doesn't support mkdir -p for nested directories
- Windows uses echo.> instead of touch for file creation
- Command quoting may differ between platforms
- Document all platform-specific adaptations in techContext.md

```

## REFERENCE VERIFICATION

At the end of each section, verify:
- [ ] Required reference files were consulted using standard format
- [ ] Key insights were documented
- [ ] Section implementation incorporates reference insights
- [ ] Reference consultation marked as complete

Explicitly document the reference check process to prevent skipping this critical step. The standardized format ensures thorough consultation of example files and reduces the risk of implementation errors.
