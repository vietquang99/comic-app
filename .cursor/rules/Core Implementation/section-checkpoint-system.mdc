# ENHANCED SECTION CHECKPOINT SYSTEM

> **TL;DR:** This system adds clear, prominent checkpoint markers at the end of each workflow section with YES/NO questions to verify completion before moving on. The system uses tasks.md as the single source of truth for task status tracking.

## üö® SECTION TRANSITION MARKERS

Use these visual markers to clearly indicate section transitions:

```
======== INITIALIZATION COMPLETE ‚üπ STARTING DOCUMENTATION SETUP ========

======== DOCUMENTATION SETUP COMPLETE ‚üπ STARTING TASK PLANNING ========

======== TASK PLANNING COMPLETE ‚üπ STARTING IMPLEMENTATION ========

======== IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ‚üπ STARTING REFLECTION ========

======== REFLECTION COMPLETE ‚üπ STARTING ARCHIVING ========

======== ARCHIVING COMPLETE ‚üπ TASK FINISHED ========
```

## ‚úì ENHANCED CHECKPOINT TEMPLATE

```
‚úì SECTION CHECKPOINT: [SECTION NAME]
- Requirement 1? [YES/NO]
- Requirement 2? [YES/NO]

```

```
‚úì SECTION CHECKPOINT: TASK PLANNING

- Reference check completed? [YES/NO]

‚Üí If all YES: Ready for IMPLEMENTATION
‚Üí If any NO: Fix missing items before proceeding
```

## ‚úì PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CREATIVE PHASE CHECKPOINT

```
‚úì CREATIVE PHASE CHECKPOINT: REQUIRED BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION
For Level 3-4 tasks, all creative phases MUST be completed before implementation:

- Level 3-4 task confirmed? [YES/NO]
- Architecture/design decisions identified? [YES/NO]
- Creative phases completed for ALL identified components? [YES/NO]
- Each creative phase contains problem breakdown? [YES/NO]
- Each creative phase includes options with pros/cons? [YES/NO]
- Each creative phase includes verification against requirements? [YES/NO]
- Each creative phase has proper entry/exit markers? [YES/NO]
- Creative phases documented in tasks.md? [YES/NO]

‚Üí If any [NO]: IMPLEMENTATION BLOCKED - Complete creative phases first
‚Üí If all [YES]: Ready for IMPLEMENTATION
```

## ‚úì IMPLEMENTATION CHECKPOINT

```
‚úì SECTION CHECKPOINT: IMPLEMENTATION
- All planned steps completed? [YES/NO]
- Command results documented (success or failure)? [YES/NO]
- Alternative approaches documented where needed? [YES/NO]
- Task statuses updated in tasks.md? [YES/NO]
- Implementation details added to activeContext.md? [YES/NO]
- Creative phases used for complex components (Level 3-4)? [YES/NO/NA]
- Reference check completed? [YES/NO]
- Section tracking updated to [X]? [YES/NO]

‚Üí If all YES: Ready for REFLECTION
‚Üí If any NO: Fix missing items before proceeding
```

## ‚úì REFLECTION CHECKPOINT

```
‚úì SECTION CHECKPOINT: REFLECTION
- "What Went Well" section with ‚â•3 items? [YES/NO]
- "Challenges" section with ‚â•2 items? [YES/NO]
- "Lessons Learned" section with ‚â•3 items? [YES/NO]
- "Improvements for Next Time" section with ‚â•3 items? [YES/NO]
- Platform-specific insights included? [YES/NO]
- Memory Bank files updated with learnings? [YES/NO]
- Reference check completed? [YES/NO]
- Section tracking updated to [X]? [YES/NO]

‚Üí If all YES: Ready for ARCHIVING
‚Üí If any NO: Fix missing items before proceeding
```

## ‚úì ARCHIVING CHECKPOINT

```
‚úì SECTION CHECKPOINT: ARCHIVING
- Archive entry created with all 4 sections? [YES/NO]
- Platform-specific insights included? [YES/NO]
- progress.md updated with reference to completed task? [YES/NO]
- activeContext.md updated with next focus? [YES/NO]
- tasks.md updated to mark task as completed? [YES/NO]
- All template/placeholder text removed? [YES/NO]
- Reference check completed? [YES/NO]
- Section tracking updated to [X]? [YES/NO]

‚Üí If all YES: TASK COMPLETE
‚Üí If any NO: Fix missing items before finishing
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION REMINDERS

Add these reminders at specific points during implementation:

### At the beginning of IMPLEMENTATION section:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION REMINDERS:
- Execute ONE command at a time
- Update task status in tasks.md
- Add implementation details to activeContext.md
- Enter creative phases for ANY new design decisions encountered
```

### After every 3 implementation steps:
```
‚è±Ô∏è TASK STATUS CHECKPOINT: 
- Is task status updated in tasks.md? [YES/NO]
- Are implementation details added to activeContext.md? [YES/NO]
```

## ‚úì IMPLEMENTATION STEP CHECKPOINT

For each implementation step, use this mini-checkpoint:

```
‚úì STEP CHECKPOINT: [STEP NAME]
- Step documented? [YES/NO]
- Command executed ONE at a time? [YES/NO]
- Result documented? [YES/NO]
- Task status updated in tasks.md? [YES/NO]
- Implementation details added to activeContext.md? [YES/NO]
- Creative phase used if design decision needed? [YES/NO/NA]
- Ready for next step? [YES/NO]
```

## üîÑ SECTION COMPLETION TEMPLATE

When completing a section, use both the checkpoint and transition marker:

```
‚úì SECTION CHECKPOINT: [SECTION NAME]
[Fill in YES/NO for each item]

üîÑ SECTION: [SECTION NAME] COMPLETE
[X] Updated section tracking

======== [SECTION NAME] COMPLETE ‚üπ STARTING [NEXT SECTION] ========
```

## HOW TO USE ENHANCED CHECKPOINTS

1. Place the relevant checkpoint template at the end of each section
2. Answer each question with [YES] or [NO]
3. If any [NO], fix those items before proceeding
4. Update the section tracking only after all checkpoint items are [YES]
5. Add the section transition marker
6. Begin the next section

This enhanced checkpoint system ensures no critical steps are missed during workflow execution, with more prominent visual indicators and clearer verification steps.
