# CROSS-LINKING REQUIREMENTS

> **TL;DR:** After archiving a task, create specific cross-links in progress.md to reference the archive entry, update activeContext.md with the completion status, and mark the task as completed in tasks.md. Use the exact formats shown below.

## üîó CROSS-LINKING FORMATS

After completing and archiving a task, create these cross-links:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ In progress.md:
```markdown
## Completed Tasks
- [Task Name] - Completed on YYYY-MM-DD, see [archive entry](mdc:../docs/archive/completed_tasks.md#task-task-name-v10)
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ In activeContext.md:
```markdown
## Recent Completions
- [Task Name] has been completed and archived. Next focus is on [Next Task].
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ In tasks.md:
```markdown
## Completed Tasks
- [X] [Task Name] - Completed on YYYY-MM-DD
```

## üìù FORMAT DETAILS

### For progress.md:
- Section title: `## Completed Tasks`
- Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Link text: `archive entry`
- Link format: `mdc:../docs/archive/completed_tasks.md#task-task-name-v10`
- Anchor rules:
  * Convert task name to lowercase
  * Replace spaces with hyphens
  * Add `-v10` suffix (no parentheses or periods)
  * NOTE: This should match format `## Task: Task Name v10` in archive

### For activeContext.md:
- Section title: `## Recent Completions`
- Format: `[Task Name] has been completed and archived. Next focus is on [Next Task].`
- End with period
- Use exact task names

### For tasks.md:
- Section title: `## Completed Tasks`
- Format: `- [X] [Task Name] - Completed on YYYY-MM-DD`
- Use exact task names
- Keep the [X] checkbox format

## üîÑ CROSS-LINKING PROCEDURE

1. Archive task in completed_tasks.md
2. Mark task as completed in tasks.md
3. Add entry to progress.md with link to archive
4. Update activeContext.md with completion status

## ‚úì CROSS-LINKING CHECKLIST

Before completing any task, verify:
- [ ] tasks.md shows task marked as [X] complete
- [ ] progress.md contains link to archive entry with exact format
- [ ] activeContext.md contains Recent Completions section with exact format
- [ ] All links are valid and working
- [ ] Task names match exactly between all files
- [ ] Date format is YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Link anchor format is correct (lowercase, hyphens, v10)

## üìã EXAMPLES

### tasks.md example:
```markdown
## Completed Tasks
- [X] Todo Application - Completed on 2023-04-15
- [X] API Integration - Completed on 2023-05-20
```

### progress.md example:
```markdown
## Completed Tasks
- Todo Application - Completed on 2023-04-15, see [archive entry](mdc:../docs/archive/completed_tasks.md#task-todo-application-v10)
- API Integration - Completed on 2023-05-20, see [archive entry](mdc:../docs/archive/completed_tasks.md#task-api-integration-v10)
```

### Archive heading example:
```markdown
## Task: Todo Application v10
```

### activeContext.md example:
```markdown
## Recent Completions
- API Integration has been completed and archived. Next focus is on User Authentication.
```

## üîç EXISTING SECTIONS HANDLING

If "Completed Tasks" already exists in progress.md or tasks.md:
- Add new entry to existing section
- Keep newest tasks at top
- Preserve existing entries

If "Recent Completions" already exists in activeContext.md:
- Replace existing content with new entry
- Show only the most recent completion
