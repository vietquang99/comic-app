# VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (SIMPLIFIED)

> **TL;DR:** Before completing any task, run through this verification checklist. A task is only complete when all checks pass. This version uses tasks.md as the single source of truth for task status.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFICATION COMMITMENT

Add this at the start of every task:
```
## Verification Commitment
I WILL run the full verification checklist before completing this task.
I will maintain tasks.md as the single source of truth for task status.
```

## üìã QUICK VERIFICATION STEPS

Before finishing any task, verify these essentials:

1. **File Types:** Critical files have correct type (file vs. directory)
2. **Platform:** Commands adapted for current operating system
3. **Workflow:** All 6 sections completed in correct order
4. **Tasks:** All task statuses updated in tasks.md
5. **Commands:** All commands executed one at a time
6. **Documentation:** Implementation details added to activeContext.md
7. **Archive:** Task properly archived with all sections
8. **Links:** Cross-references properly set up

## üö® TOP 5 MOST COMMON FAILURES

1. **.cursorrules as directory:** Created .cursorrules as a directory instead of a file
2. **Incorrect task tracking:** Updated task status in multiple files or wrong file
3. **Command chaining:** Used && or similar to chain commands
4. **Insufficient implementation details:** Failed to add details to activeContext.md
5. **Missing creative phases:** Failed to use creative phases for major architectural/design decisions

## üì± QUICK FIX REFERENCE

If any verification check fails, use these quick fixes:

### ‚úì Fix: .cursorrules as directory
```bash
# Remove directory and create file
```

### ‚úì Fix: Missing task status in tasks.md
```
# Update tasks.md with proper status
```

### ‚úì Fix: Missing implementation details
```
# Add relevant details to activeContext.md
```

### ‚úì Fix: Missing section checkpoints
```
‚úì SECTION CHECKPOINT: [SECTION NAME]
[Answer all verification questions]
```

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION SUCCESS

When all checks pass, state:
```
All verification checks PASSED. Task is complete and properly documented.
```

If any check fails:
1. Mark it as failed
2. Fix it immediately using the quick fix reference
3. Re-verify
